PREAMBLE
 D iabetes has become a global problem and the epidemic is most pronounced in South East Asia particularly 
India where an estimated 72 million people are believed to have diabetes and another 80 million have pre-diabetes. 
More than 90 – 95% of all patients with diabetes have type 2 diabetes. The treatment of type 2 diabetes has undergone 
rapid changes in the last decade, and several new drugs have been introduced in the market. 
 In 2005, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) brought out the ‘Guidelines for Management of 
Type 2 Diabetes’ as a small book and this has found wide application all over India. As more than a decade has 
elapsed since the publication of that document, ICMR felt that a revision of the  Guidelines for Management of Type 
2 Diabetes was indicated. An expert group was constituted by ICMR, to look at the old guidelines and to suggest 
modifications as may be needed, based on the latest developments in the management of type 2 diabetes. 
 After several rounds of iteration, a document was prepared which was then circulated to a few additional 
experts. After getting the comments from these  experts, an ICMR Workshop entitled ‘ICMR GUIDELINES FOR 
MANAGEMENT OF TYPE 2 DIABETES 2018’ was held at Chennai on 10th January 2018 and a group of experts was 
invited by ICMR. The Workshop was divided into different sections. Each part of the document was studied in detail 
and necessary changes were made to the document.  The document was then placed in the ICMR website, giving an 
opportunity for anyone else who wished to view the documents and give their comments or suggestions to do so. A 
few additional suggestions were received which were also incorporated in the final document. 
 We now have great pleasure in publishing the ‘ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 2018’. 
We trust that this booklet will be useful not only for practicing physicians and general practitioners but also for medical 
students (both undergraduates and postgraduates) and also for nurses, educators and other paramedical personnel.  
We welcome feedback and suggestions from readers so that when the next set of guidelines is prepared by ICMR, 
these suggestions can be incorporated. 
 We also wish to thank ICMR for their guidance and support and all the experts for the time and effort they 
spent in making this document. A special word of thanks to Dr. Ranjit Unnikrishnan who painstakingly compiled all the 
suggestions and comments and helped finalize the document.

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20181
SECTION 1    INTRODUCTION
1.1 Definition
Diabetes mellitus is a syndrome of multiple etiologies characterized by chronic 
hyperglycaemia with disturbances of carbohydrate, fat and protein metabolism 
resulting from defects in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. This disorder is often 
associated with long term complications, involving organs like eyes, kidneys, nerves, 
heart and blood vessels.
1.2 Epidemiology
In recent decades,  India has witnessed a rapidly exploding epidemic of diabetes. 
Indeed, India today has the second largest number of people with diabetes in the 
world. The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) estimates that there are 72.9 million 
people with diabetes in India in 2017, which is projected to rise to 134.3 million by the 
year 2045. The prevalence of diabetes in urban India, especially in large metropolitan 
cities has increased from 2% in the 1970s to over 20% at present and the rural areas 
are also fast catching up.
1.3 Types of diabetes
According to the American Diabetes Association and the World Health Organisation, 
diabetes can be classified into four main types (see Box) .
Classification of Diabetes
 zType 1 diabetes
 zType 2 diabetes
 zGestational diabetes
 zOther types of diabetes (Monogenic diabetes, pancreatic diabetes,  
drug-induced diabetes etc.)
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20182
Of these, the tw o most important forms of diabetes are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. 
Type 1 diabetes is primarily due to autoimmune-mediated destruction of pancreatic 
beta cells, resulting in absolute insulin deficiency and thus requiring insulin for good 
health and survival. While type 1 diabetes is also on the increase, the actual numbers 
of people with type 1 diabetes in India is, relatively speaking, still small. Type 2 
diabetes, on the other hand, accounts for over 90-95% of all people with diabetes and 
is characterized by insulin resistance and abnormal insulin secretion, either of which 
may predominate. The diabetes epidemic relates particularly to type 2 diabetes, 
and predominantly due to the changing lifestyles, urbanization, d emography and 
increased longevity.
1.4 Differentiating Between Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes
Table 1.1 below provides a few clinical points to differentiate between type 1 and type 
2 diabetes.

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20183
Type 1 diabetes will not be discussed further in these guidelines and they pertain 
chiefly to type 2 diabetes.  
Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic-cum-vascular syndrome characterized by 
predominant insulin resistance with varying degrees of insulin secretory defect. It 
is a progressive disease often associated with central obesity, dyslipidaemia and 
hypertension. It is more common in overweight and obese individuals of middle to 
late age but is increasingly being seen in younger age groups and in those with lower 
body mass index (BMI) as well. The “Asian Indian phenotype” refers to a peculiar 
constellation of abnormalities in south Asians, whereby for any given level of BMI, 
they tend to have higher total body fat, visceral fat, insulin resistance and prevalence 
of diabetes compared to white Caucasians ( Figure 1.1 ).

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20184
1.5 Goals for management
 zRelief from symptoms of diabetes and improvement in quality of life
 zGlycemic control and prevention of acute complications
 zIdentification and management of comorbid conditions like obesity, 
hypertension and dyslipidaemia
 zPrevention of microvascular complications like retinopathy, neuropathy and 
nephropathy
 zPrevention of macro-vascular complications like cardiovascular, 
cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular disease
 zPrevention of infections
The complete treatment of people with diabetes requires advocating a healthy life 
style with focus on increased physical activity and a proper balanced diet in addition 
to prescribing medications.
1.6 Diabetes Education
Diabetes education means empowering people with diabetes with knowledge and 
providing tools crucial for making them active partners in the diabetes management 
team. These include:
 zIn-depth information about diabetes, its complications and treatment
 zAppropriate self care skills
 zAppropriate resources for self care
 zA positive attitude
 zSelf monitoring skills
The compliance of people with diabetes is essential for effective management of 
diabetes. Education programmes are intended to help people to understand why these 
actions are so important and thereby increase their motivation for self-management.Lo
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20185
1.7 Prevention of Diabetes
There is an urgent need for strategies to prevent or at least slow down the emerging 
epidemic of diabetes apart from treating diabetes and associated complications. 
Several factors are thought to contribute towards the acceleration of the epidemic, 
the most important being the rapid epidemiological transition due to urbanization and 
life style changes. Identifying individuals at risk is essential in planning preventive 
measures. Prevention of diabetes has several windows of opportunities ( Figure  1.2).

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20186
The three stages of prevention are:
1.7.1 Primordial prevention  attempts to reduce the risk factors for diabetes, e.g., 
reducing or preventing obesity to reduce the future risk of diabetes.
1.7.2 Primary prevention  targets people who are in the stage of prediabetes 
to prevent the onset of diabetes. All people with prediabetes should be regularly 
screened and encouraged at each health care visit to pursue a healthy life-style, 
including a healthy diet, adequate exercise and weight control in order to prevent 
diabetes. Several studies including from India have shown that diabetes can be 
prevented in up to a third of people with prediabetes. When lifestyle alone is not 
sufficient and especially in those with combined IFG and IGT where progression to 
type 2 diabetes appear imminent, use of metformin in addition to lifestyle  measures 
may be considered especially in Indians who progress rapidly to diabetes from the 
prediabetes stage.
1.7.3 Secondary prevention  is to prevent the onset of complications in those 
who are already diagnosed to have diabetes. This can be achieved by meticulous 
control of diabetes with the help of diet, physical activity, life style modification and 
antihyperglycaemic drugs as indicated. Control should include holistic care beyond 
glycemic control i.e. attention to blood pressure, lipids etc.
1.7.4 Tertiary prevention of diabetes is aimed at limiting physical disability and 
rehabilitation measures in those who have already developed diabetic complications 
and preventing them from going into end stage complications of diabetes.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20187
SECTION 2    SCREENING FOR TYPE 2 DIABETES
Type 2 diabetes occurs a much earlier age (at least a decade earlier) in Indians 
compared to other major ethnic groups. Screening of asymptomatic individuals 
allows diagnosis of diabetes and prediabetes to be made at an earlier stage and 
thus appropriate management can be instituted. In addition, it provides an opportunity 
for screening of cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors and the institution of 
interventions for their control. Early detection of diabetes has been shown to improve 
outcomes.
2.1 Whom and when to screen?
Screening should be performed in all individuals >30 years of age. It should be carried 
out at an earlier age in adults who have one or more of the following risk factors: 
 zFamily history of diabetes 
 zOverweight/obese (BMI ≥23 kg/m2) or have increased waist circumference 
(>90 cm males, >80 cm females)
 zHistory of hypertension (≥130/80 mmHg) or on treatment for hypertension
 zHistory of dyslipidaemia
 zSedentary physical activity
 zHistory of gestational diabetes or macrosomia (birth weight > 3.5 kg)
 zHistory of CVD (ischaemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease)
 zHistory of polycystic ovarian syndrome and/or acanthosis nigricans 
2.2 How to screen?
Screening can be done by fasting plasma glucose, an oral glucose tolerance test 
(OGTT) using 75 gm glucose or a random plasma glucose.  Glycosylated (glycated) 
haemoglobin (HbA1c) is also recommended for screening; however, in India there are 
some limitations regarding its use.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20188
2.3 Where to screen?
Preferably, screening should be done in a health care setting. Alternatively, 
community screening can also be done.
2.4 Retesting:
Retesting should be done after 3 years in case of normal glucose tolerance. In 
case of prediabetes, it should be done annually.
2.5 Other aspects:
CVD risk factors such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, tobacco use and case of 
sedentary lifestyle should be identi fied and treated.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 20189
SECTION 3  DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA 
3.1 Diagnostic Criteria for Diabetes
 zSymptoms of diabetes (see Section 3.2) plus casual or random plasma 
glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (Casual means without regard to time of last meal)
 zFasting plasma glucose ≥ 126 mg/dl*
 z2 hour post 75 g glucose ≥ 200 mg/dl (as part of OGTT)*
 zGlycated Haemoglobin ≥ 6.5%*
*Diabetes diagnosed using any of these criteria should be confirmed with another 
test subsequently. 
3.2 Symptoms of Diabetes
 zOsmotic symptoms- polyuria, polydipsia
 zWeight loss in spite of polyphagia
 zTiredness, weakness
 zGeneralised pruritus
 zRecurrent urogenital infections
 zDelayed healing of wounds
More than half of all patients with diabetes will have no symptoms at all
3.3 Criteria for the Diagnosis of Prediabetes 
  The term “prediabetes” refers to a situation where the blood glucose levels 
are higher than normal, but not high enough to warrant a diagnosis of diabetes. 
Prediabetes consists of two entities viz. impaired fasting glucose (IFG) and impaired 
gluose tolerance (IGT). 
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201810
The diagnostic criteria for diabetes and prediabetes are summarized in  
Table 3.1

3.4  Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)
 zPerson to be tested should be on a normal diet (with at least 200 g carbohydrate/
day) for at least 3 days before the test
 zThe test should be done after an overnight fast of 8-10 hours and comprises 
of two blood samples: fasting and 2 hours after glucose load
 zFollowing the collection of the fasting blood sample for analysis of plasma 
glucose, the individual should be administered 75 g of glucose (1.75 g/ kg 
body weight for children to a maximum of 75 g) dissolved in at least 250 ml of 
water. The glucose load should be drunk within a period of 5 minutes
The second sample should be collected 2 hours after the glucose load is given. 
The subject should be resting and refrain from smoking and eating in between the two 
sample collections. 
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201811
3.5 Testing for Type 2 Diabetes in Children and Adolescents
Children and adolescents aged 18 years and below should be screened for 
diabetes if they are overweight (weight>120% of ideal body weight) and have any of 
the following risk factors:
 zFamily history of type 2 diabetes in first degree relatives
 zSigns of insulin resistance (Acanthosis nigricans) 
 zHypertension
 zDyslipidaemia
 zPolycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS)
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201812
SECTION 4 TARGETS FOR CONTROL OF DIABETES 
   Any target is only a general guideline, and individualized targets are to be 
established. Tight glycemic control is essential in the early stages of diabetes, 
especially in the young to prevent complications. With the onset of complications 
and in the elderly, targets need to be revised based on the condition of the patient. 
4.1 Targets for metabolic control in diabetes 
Blood glucose, blood pressure, BMI, waist circumference and lipid targets for a 
patient with diabetes are listed in Table 4.1 and Table 4.2  below. 
Table 4.1: Targets for metabolic control in diabetes
Ideal Satisfactory Unsatisfactory

  Triglycerides (mg/dl) <150
*For those at high risk (established CVD, smoking, obesity, hypertension, family 
history of premature CVD and evidence of other vascular disease), LDL  cholesterol 
<70mg/dl is recommended
4.2. Glycemic targets during pregnancy
Tight glycemic control is most essential during pregnancy. Glycemic targets during 
pregnancy  are presented in Table 4.3.

Physician may request for either for a 1 hour or 2 hour postprandial blood  glucose 
value for purposes of monitoring.
 
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201814
SECTION 5  MONITORING AND FOLLOW UP OF PEOPLE WITH DIABETES    
5.1 How to Monitor and Follow up People with Diabetes?
 zBlood glucose - FPG and 2 hr PPPG at least once a month and more often if 
values are not in the ideal target range
 zHbA1c at least every 6-12 months and more often (every 3 months) if values 
are not in the ideal target range, or tight control is being attempted  
 zClinical examination needs to be done during every visit--- minimum every 3 
months
 zScreening for long term complications like retinopathy, nephropathy, 
neuropathy, peripheral vascular disease (PVD) and coronary artery disease 
(CAD) at least once a year, more often if needed (see Section 8)
 zOptimizing weight, waist, blood pressure, lipids
 zRoutine examination of foot to be done during every visit & education regarding 
foot care to be given to patients in each visit
 zDiscourage tobacco use and excess use of alcohol
Urine glucose monitoring is not recommended.  Urine examination for estimation of 
ketones should be done if blood glucose is greater than 400 mg/dl.
5.2 Self Monitoring of Blood Glucose (SMBG) with Glucose Monitor
It is indicated in the following conditions:
 zIdeal for every patient to achieve better control of diabetes
 zAll people with diabetes on insulin
 zBrittle diabetes
 zThose prone to ketosis/recurrent hypoglycaemia
 zHypoglycaemia unawareness
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201815
 zWhenever tight control is indicated — pregnancy, acute illness and 
complications
 zFrequency of SMBG should be individualised (e.g. with greater frequency in 
pregnancy)
5.3 What to do during Annual Check-Up?
 zBasic clinical exam including detailed foot exam with palpation of dorsalis 
pedis and posterior tibial pulses, monofilament and vibration perception 
testing (VPT) (See Section 8)
 zRetinal check-up (fundus examination for retinopathy)
 zBlood urea / serum creatinine
 zUrine — protein/albumin, micro-albuminuria if available or at least Urinary 
Albumin by dipstick
 zECG 
 zLipids
 zHemogram
 zUrine routine
 zDiet/ exercise to be reinforced
 zPsychological support whenever necessary
 zTests to be carried out when indicated: X Ray chest, uric acid, TSH, SGOT, 
SGPT, vitamin B12, electrolytes, ultrasound abdomen
Advanced monitoring can be done if required in case of recurrent hypoglycaemia, 
severe fluctuations in blood glucose, disparity in measured glucose values and 
HbA1c, severe anaemia, haemoglobinopathy, hypoglycaemia unawareness etc.  Here 
Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) for 5-7 days or iSCGM (intermittently scanned 
CGM) for 14 days may be used.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201816
SECTION 6 NON-PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES   
6.1. Lifestyle Goals in Diabetes
 zTo improve health through optimum nutrition
 zTo provide energy for reasonable body weight , normal growth and development
 zTo maintain glycemic control
 zTo achieve optimum blood lipid levels
 zTo individualise the diet according  to complications and co-morbidities
 zAchieve optimal physical activity
 zAdvise other behavioural changes for: smoking, other tobacco products and 
alcohol
 zAdvocate stress management 
6.2 Medical Nutrition Therapy (MNT) for diabetes mellitus requires application of 
nutritional and behavioral sciences along with physical activity .
We need a four-pronged approach:
 zNutritional assessment which includes metabolic, nutritional and life style 
parameters
 zSetting goals – practical, achievable and acceptable to the patient-- 
individualised
 zNutritional Intervention, including nutrition education – individualized meal 
plans according to family eating patterns
 zEvaluation – to assess if the goals have been achieved and to make necessary 
changes
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201817
Based on factors like age, sex, physical activity, height, weight, body mass index 
(BMI) and cultural factors, the diet is planned. The diet should be individualized, close 
to the family pattern, flexible, should have variety and meal timing should be according 
to the patient’s daily schedule.
6.2.1 Dietary Recommendations:
(i) Energy:
Sufficient to attain or maintain a reasonable body weight for adults, normal growth 
and development for children and adolescents, to meet the increased needs during 
pregnancy and lactation and recovery from illness. Daily physical activity and exercise 
needs to be considered.
Ideal Body Weight (IBW) = (Height in cm – 100) * 0.9.
Approximately, 25 kcals/kg ideal body weight/day can be given to a moderately 
active patient with diabetes. The change in the daily calorie should be a gradual 
process, and not more than 500 calories/day.
(ii) Energy or Calorie Distribution:
(a) Carbohydrates: 
Evidence is inconclusive for an ideal amount of carbohydrate intake for people 
with diabetes. Therefore, collaborative goals should be developed for individuals 
with diabetes. 55-60 % of energy from carbohydrates is an ideal recommendation. 
Carbohydrates should be complex in nature. Although different carbohydrates produce 
different glycemic responses, from clinical point of view it is important to manage total 
carbohydrate. It is recommended that carbohydrates from foods high in fibre e.g. 
whole grains (unpolished cereals and millets), legumes, peas, beans, oats, barley 
and some fruits with low glycemic index and glycemic load are consumed. All patients 
with diabetes should be encouraged to take 6 small meals a day. Food exchange 
system can be followed to give more variety and individualization to the diet plan.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201818
(a) Fibre:
Fibre recommendation for general population is 40 g/day (2000 Kcals).
Traditional Indian diets that include whole grains along with whole pulses like 
grams, soy, green leafy vegetables and some fruits is the recommendation. Fruits like 
papaya, guava, apples, pears, oranges, mosambi can be taken in moderation. All fruit 
juices are best avoided. 
(b) Proteins:
Proteins should provide 12-15 % of the total energy intake for people with diabetes – 
similar to the recommendations for the general population.
Proteins from vegetable sources like pulses, soy, grams, peas as well as form low 
fat milk, low fat curds, fish and lean meats are recommended.
Supplementation of foods like cereal and pulse (4:1 ratio) can improve the protein 
quality and also gives satiety. For e.g; Idli, dosa, Missi roti, Khichdi, Dhokla, Khandvi 
etc.
(c) Fats:
Fats should provide 20-30 % of total energy intake for people with diabetes. 
Evidence is inconclusive for an ideal amount of total fat intake for people with 
diabetes, therefore, goals should be individualized. Fat quality is as important as the 
quantity.
Fat quality
 zSaturated fats (SFA) ≤10% energy and 7% in those with raised blood lipid 
levels
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201819
 zPolyunsaturated fats (PUFA) 10 % energy, n6: 3-7% energy, n3: >1% energy, 
n6/n3 ratio 5-10
 zMonounsaturated Fatty Acids (MUFA) 10-15% energy + any calories left from 
the carbohydrate portion
 zTrans fats < 1% energy – preferably totally avoided
In people with type 2 diabetes, MUFA-rich cooking oil and nuts in moderation may 
benefit glycemic control and CVD risk factors. This can therefore be recommended 
as an effective alternative to a lower-fat, higher-carbohydrate eating pattern. Use of 
MUFA rich oils like mustard, rice bran, peanut (groundnut) and gingelly are good 
options. Oils rich in n6 PUFA like safflower, sunflower, cotton seed, should be mixed 
with oils rich in n3 like soy and mustard to maintain N6:N3 ratio between 5-10.  Use 
of mixed oils or alternating of oils is recommended.
(iii) Salt:
Sodium intake recommendations for people with diabetes are the same as that for 
the general population. Added (iodized) salt should be less than 5 g/day. For persons 
with hypertension and diabetes, the intake should be reduced to less than 3 g/ day. 
In hypertensive patients or edematous patients with nephropathy, sodium restriction 
is required. All preserved and processed foods such as pickles, chutneys, packaged 
namkeens/savouries, sauces should be restricted. 
(iv) Alcohol:
It is best to avoid alcohol, however if used, should be taken in moderation. If alcohol 
is consumed, it should not be counted as part of the meal plan. However, it should be 
borne in mind that alcohol does provide calories (7 kcal/ g), which are considered as 
“empty calories”. In the fasting state, alcohol may produce hypoglycaemia. Alcohol 
can further exacerbate fatty liver, neuropathy, dyslipidaemia, obesity and also worsen 
blood glucose levels.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201820
(v) Sweeteners:
Nutritive Sweeteners : These include fructose, honey, corn syrup, molasses, fruit 
juice or fruit juice concentrates dextrose, maltose, mannitol, sorbitol and xylitol.. All 
these are best avoided.
Non-nutritive Sweeteners : Aspartame, acesulfame K, stevia, sucralose and 
saccharin are currently approved for use. However, they should be used in moderation 
and are best avoided in pregnancy. 
6.2.2 Dietary modifications in the presence of complications of diabetes: 
(i) Nephropathy: 
(a) Protein : The recommended protein intake for diabetic nephropathy patients is 
0.6 g/kg of the ideal body weight plus 24 hour urinary protein loss, if this is significant.  
However, it is recommended that the protein intake should not be less than 40 g/
day. For patients with increased creatinine, protein restriction should be advised in 
consultation with the nephrologist.
(b) Sodium: It could vary from 1000 mg to 2000 mg/day depending upon the fluid 
status and serum sodium levels.
(c) Potassium: Potassium restriction may be required depending upon the 
potassium values in the blood and type of diuretic being used.
(ii) Cardiovascular Disease:
(a) Maintaining an optimal body weight and restricting salt.  Use of fruits and 
vegetables should be encouraged, with good quality fats in moderation.
(b) Dyslipidaemia :  Saturated and trans fats food sources like vanaspati,  butter, 
ghee, margarine, coconut oil, red meats like sausages, ham, bacon, egg yellow, whole 
milk and its products should be restricted. Use of healthy oils and fibre rich foods is 
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201821
recommended. Vegetarians can take flax seeds (10 g / day) in their diet as both fish 
and flax seeds are rich in omega-3 fatty acids which is protective for heart disease. 
Alcohol restriction will bring down the triglycerides. Dietary management should be 
accompanied with regular physical activity and exercise regimen.
6.2.3 Special situations requiring dietary modification:
(i) Sick Days
In the event of fever or other illness, the diabetic diet should be modified by 
changing the consistency and texture of foods to maintain adequate calorie intake. 
Semi solid foods and fluids or items like thin soups, milk, buttermilk, or fresh lime juice 
should be encouraged.
6.2.4 Lifestyle Management:
(i) Tobacco: 
Smoking and tobacco chewing is totally prohibited.
(ii) Stress: 
Stress management is essential which could take the form of meditation, yoga, a 
long outdoor walk, exercise and trying out hobbies like reading, gardening, painting 
etc. Practice of yoga is our traditional Indian system, which has therapeutic value in 
controlling our physical and mental health. It should be done under the guidance of 
an expert.
6.3 Physical Activity and Exercise
Regular physical activity along with regulated exercise is an essential component of 
management of type 2 diabetes. Complete evaluation of patients with diabetes should 
be performed before recommending an exercise program. The exercise programme 
has to be individualized according to one’s ability and individual capacity. 
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201822
Benefits of exercise 
 zImproves insulin sensitivity, reduces the  risk of heart disease, high blood 
pressure, bone diseases, and unhealthy weight gain
 zKeeps one flexible and agile
 zHelps relieve stress, anxiety and prevents depression
 zIncreases strength and stamina 
 zPromotes sound sleep
 zIncreases metabolic rate and digestion
 zLowers lipids
 zDelays the process of aging 
Recommendation is about 150 minutes of aerobic activity or its equivalent /week 
along  with some resistance training at least twice a week and flexibility exercises.
 People with diabetes need an extra quick acting carbohydrate snack before the 
exercise and during the exercise, if the exercise period extends the daily-recommended 
routine.
6.4  Yoga and Diabetes
The practice of yoga is a traditional Indian system, which has gained international 
recognition as a means of developing stress coping skills and is increasingly being 
suggested as a part of holistic diabetes management. Some of the aspects used in 
yoga are:
• Asanas (involving postures) 
• Pranayama (involving breath) 
• Dhyana (involving meditation) 
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201823
While the details of these techniques are beyond the scope of these Guidelines, 
there is growing evidence to suggest that yoga may benefit patients with type 
2 diabetes. Yogic practices may beneficially impact several aspects of diabetes 
management, such as glycemic control, lipids, and body fat content. Other suggested 
benefits include reduction in oxidative stress and blood pressure, improvement of 
pulmonary and autonomic function, mood, sleep, and quality of life; and reduction 
in doses of anti-diabetic medication. However, there is an urgent need for additional 
high-quality studies to confirm the potential benefits of yoga as well as its mechanisms 
of action in this patient population and some such studies have been initiated.

SECTION 7 PHARMACOLOGICAL MANAGEMENT OF DIABETES    
This section is divided into
1. Oral anti-hyperglycaemic drugs
2. Insulin therapy
3. Non-insulin injectable therapy
7.1 Anti-Hyperglycaemic  Drugs
Blood glucose levels are determined by several factors such as absorption of 
glucose from gut, uptake of glucose by peripheral tissues (muscle, adipose tissue), 
hepatic glucose output, and secretion of hormones such as insulin and glucagon 
from the pancreas and incretins from the gut, as well as renal handling of glucose. 
Various anti-hyperglycaemic agents act by modifying the factors aiding in the control 
of hyperglycaemia as shown in Figure 7.1.  The oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents 
currently available in India are listed in Table 7.1.

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201828
7.1.1 Biguanides: 
Metformin is the only biguanide available in clinical practice. It mediates its effect 
by enhancing sensitivity of the liver and peripheral tissues to circulating insulin. The 
recommended starting daily dose is 500 mg after meals, which may be increased by 
500 mg every two weeks until desired therapeutic goals are achieved or maximum 
daily doses (2500 mg) are reached. It can be used in combination with any other oral 
or injectable anti-hyperglycaemic agents. Metformin rarely produces hypoglycaemia 
when used as monotherapy. It is also associated with weight loss and is hence 
recommended as the first line treatment in type 2 diabetes. Metformin has a favorable 
effect on lipids by decreasing triglycerides. It is advisable to stop metformin at least 24 
hours before elective major surgery or use of radiocontrast media. Metformin should 
be withdrawn if any contraindications to its use occur.
(a) Side effects:  
 zGastrointestinal side effects like abdominal discomfort and diarrhoea may 
occur in some patients. These can be minimized if metformin is administered 
after meals with slow titration of doses and with the use of sustained release 
preparations
 zLactic acidosis is a rare side effect and is very uncommon unless metformin is 
given in the presence of contraindications, given below
 zProlonged use of metformin may be associated with vitamin B12 deficiency
(b) Contraindications:
 zRenal insufficiency ( see Box )
 zHepatic insufficiency
 zRespiratory insufficiency and other hypoxemic conditions
 zAcute myocardial infarction
 zCongestive cardiac failure
 zAlcohol abuse
 zKetoacidosis
 zSevere infections
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201829
METFORMIN IN RENAL INSUFFICIENCY
The dose of metformin needs adjustment based on the patient’s renal function, 
as assessed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Metformin can be 
given in full doses if the eGFR is above 60 ml/min. If the eGFR is between 45 and 
60 ml/min, the drug can be continued at full dose with more frequent monitoring of 
renal function. Below 45 ml/min, the dose should be halved and no patient started 
anew on metformin; the drug should be stopped if the eGFR drops below 30 ml/min.
7.1.2 Sulphonylureas:
The sulphonylureas (glibenclamide, glipizide, gliclazide and glimepiride) bind to 
specific sulphonylurea receptors on pancreatic β-cells and increase insulin secretion. 
Therapy should be initiated with the lowest effective dose and titrated upwards every 
two weeks until the desired control or maximal dosage is reached. Sulphonylureas 
are preferably given 15 to 30 minutes before meals. They can be combined with all 
other anti-hyperglycaemic agents except glinides and other sulphonylureas.  Various 
clinical trials have failed to conclusively demonstrate superiority of one sulphonylurea 
over the other, when used in optimal doses. In individual cases, switching from one 
sulphonylurea to another may show some benefit, but this may not be long lasting.
(a)  Factors to be considered when evaluating non-responsiveness to  
sulphonylureas:
 zWeight gain
 zNon-compliance to diet and exercise
 zPoor compliance to drugs
 zInadequate dosage
 zImpaired absorption
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201830
 zCo-existing endocrine disorders such as thyroid disease
 zConcomitant medications such as steroids
 zInfections, stress
(b) Side effects:
Hypoglycaemia is the commonest side effect of sulphonylurea therapy. It is more 
likely to be prolonged and profound with older and long acting sulphonylureas like 
glibenclamide and hence they should be used with extreme caution in the elderly. The 
other side effects are:
 zWeight gain
 zPhotosensitivity reactions (hyperpigmentation of exposed parts) may occur
 zRarely, skin rashes, leucopenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, cholestatic 
jaundice, Stevens-Johnson syndrome or granulomatous hepatitis may occur
(c) Contraindications:
 zType 1 diabetes
 zRenal insufficiency
 zHepatic insufficiency, acute hepatitis
 zKetoacidosis
 zAcute myocardial infarction
 zExtensive infections (e.g. disseminated tuberculosis)
 zHistory of adverse reactions to sulphonylureas
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201831
7.1.3 Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (Gliptins):
These agents work by inhibiting the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4, which breaks 
down the incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent 
insulinotropic peptide (GIP) secreted from the gut in response to a meal. Increase in 
blood levels of incretin hormones stimulates glucose-dependent insulin secretion from 
the beta cells of the pancreas and suppression of glucagon release from the alpha 
cells. The main advantages of gliptins are that they do not cause hypoglycaemia when 
used as monotherapy and are weight-neutral. Sitagliptin, vildagliptin, saxagliptin, 
linagliptin, teneligliptin and gemigliptin are the DPP-4 inhibitors available in India at 
present. Most of the gliptins are used as a single daily dose except vildagliptin which 
is used twice a day. Gliptins are best used in combination with metformin as second 
line of therapy. They can also be used as monotherapy or in combination with any 
other oral antihyperglycaemic agent or insulin. The dosage should be reduced in 
the presence of renal insufficiency except in the case of linagliptin, teneligliptin and 
gemigliptin (the latter two to be used with caution in advanced renal disease).  
(a) Side effects:
 zGastrointestinal problems – including nausea, diarrhoea and stomach pain
 zFlu-like symptoms – headache, runny nose, sore throat
 zSkin reactions – painful skin followed by a red or purple rash
 zJoint pains
(b) Contraindications:  
 zAcute pancreatitis 
 zDose of sitagliptin, vildagliptin and saxagliptin should be reduced in renal 
impairment, teneligliptin and gemigliptin should be used with caution in 
advanced renal disease (linagliptin can be continued at unchanged doses)
 zAllergic reactions to gliptins
 zSaxagliptin should be avoided in cardiac failure
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201832
7.1.4 SGLT2 Inhibitors (Sodium Glucose Transporter 2 inhibitors): 
Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin and empagliflozin are the agents in this class available 
in India at present. They inhibit SGLT2 located on the proximal convoluted tubule 
of the kidney thus causing glycosuria. In addition to reducing blood glucose levels, 
these agents also cause weight loss and reduction of blood pressure. There is also 
some evidence that these agents have cardiovascular benefits over and above their 
glucose lowering effects. 
(a) Side effects:
 zGenital mycotic infections
 zUrinary tract infections
 zPolyuria
 zVolume depletion in elderly persons
 zEuglycemic ketoacidosis
 zLower extremity amputations have been reported with canagliflozin
(b) Contraindications: 
 zRecurrent genitourinary infections
 zPatients with diabetic ketoacidosis
 zType 1 diabetes
 zHypersensitivity
7.1.5. Thiazolidinediones (Glitazones): 
Pioglitazone is the only agent in this category available in India at present. It is 
an insulin sensitizer at adipose tissue and skeletal muscle. This effect is brought 
about by its binding to nuclear peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-gamma 
(PPAR-y). It also inhibits hepatic glucose output. Pioglitazone has partial PPAR-
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201833
alpha agonist activity, which accounts for its beneficial effects on lipid profile. The 
dose of pioglitazone commonly used in clinical practice ranges from 7.5 to 30 mg 
once a day. The action sets in from 2-4 weeks of starting therapy and the maximum 
effect is observed after 8-12 weeks. Pioglitazone can be combined with all other 
antihyperglycaemic agents; however, combination with insulin should be done with 
caution. Women with anovulatory cycles may ovulate when using pioglitazone; hence, 
adequate contraceptive advice should be given.
(a) Side effects:
 zWeight gain may be quite significant and is dose- related
 zEdema and cardiac failure are reported especially when combined with insulin
 zOther adverse events include anaemia and haemodilution
 zHigher risk of fractures especially in post-menopausal women
 zBladder cancer has been reported on prolonged use
(b) Contraindications and cautions: 
 zType 1 diabetes
 zHistory of cardiac failure
 zPregnancy and lactation
 zModerate to severe anaemia
 zHistory of bladder cancer or those with unexplained hematuria; known risk 
factors for bladder cancer to be assessed before starting pioglitazone
 zUse with caution in elderly and avoid use as first-line agent
 zReview use after 3 to 6 months and withdraw if clinical benefit not seen
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201834
7.1.6 Non-sulphonylurea Insulin Secretagogues (Glinides):
Repaglinide and nateglinide are non-sulphonylurea insulin secretagogues. They 
are benzoic acid derivatives, which act on separate non-sulphonylurea receptor 
binding sites on the β-cell and enhance insulin secretion. These agents are absorbed 
rapidly (0.5-1 hr) and have a short half life (<1 hr). Thus, they result in rapid but brief 
release of insulin, and hence may be useful in managing postprandial hyperglycaemia. 
They have to be administered with each meal.
 zThey produce fewer and milder hypoglycaemic episodes and other side effects 
compared to sulphonylureas
 zThe indications and contraindications for these agents are similar to 
sulphonylureas
 zThey may be used in mild renal insufficiency and elderly under supervision
 zThere is no indication for combining these drugs with sulfonylureas
7.1.7 Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors: 
Alpha- glucosidase inhibitors (AGI) (acarbose, miglitol and voglibose) act by 
competitively inhibiting alpha-glucosidase, the enzyme in the small intestine brush 
border which breaks down oligosaccharides and disaccharides into mono-saccharides. 
Thus, the absorption of glucose is delayed. AGIs are especially useful in decreasing 
post-prandial glucose levels. They can be combined with all other oral and injectable 
anti-hyperglycaemic agents.  These agents should be started with the minimum dose 
at any one meal and then increased to the maximum tolerable dose.  They must be 
ingested with the first bite of food, as the drug must be present in the small bowel 
with the food for proper effect. Hypoglycaemia rarely occurs if used as monotherapy. 
If hypoglycaemia results from combination therapy of which AGI is a component, 
treatment should be with oral glucose rather than sucrose.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201835
(a) Side effects :  Gastrointestinal side effects like bloating, abdominal discomfort,  
diarrhoea and flatulence are common.
(b) Contraindications:
 zInflammatory bowel disease
 zCirrhosis of liver
 zMalabsorption syndromes
 zModerate to  End Stage Renal Disease
7.1.8 Other oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents:
 The disease-modifying antirheumatoid drug hydroxychloroquine and the dopamine   
agonist bromocriptine are also approved for use as antihyperglycaemic agents in 
India. The role of these agents in the therapeutic algorithm for type 2 diabetes needs 
further study. The dual PPARα/γ agonist saroglitazar is only licensed for use in diabetic 
dyslipidaemia in India and not as an antihyperglycaemic agent.
7.1.9 General Guidelines for using oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents:
 Type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disease and hence treatment should be 
individualized. In every case, due emphasis should be given to encouraging healthy 
lifestyle choices such as increasing physical activity and modification of diet. In some 
cases, lifestyle changes alone would suffice to attain therapeutic targets. However, 
most patients with type 2 diabetes will need pharmacotherapy for achieving their 
glycemic goals.
To help the practitioner in selecting the optimal antihyperglycaemic agent, we 
present below a table showing the important advantages and the disadvantages of 
each class of agent ( Figure 7.2 ) and a suggested algorithm for their use ( Figure 7.3) .

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201838
 zIn practice, majority of patients will require pharmacotherapy at time of 
diagnosis along with lifestyle modification
 zIf the initial blood glucose levels are very high, the symptoms are very severe 
or acute complications like ketosis are present, insulin should be considered 
even at the onset at least for a brief period for early achievement of euglycemia
 zIf the initial assessment shows presence of complications like diabetic 
retinopathy or nephropathy, this indicates a long period of undiagnosed 
diabetes and insulin therapy on a continuous basis should be considered
 zWith increasing duration of diabetes, most oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents 
tend to become less effective and hence poly-pharmacy becomes inevitable, 
with use of drugs from multiple classes. However, insulin use should not 
be delayed and whenever necessary, insulin should be introduced for tight 
glycemic control
7.1.10 Combination of oral drugs with insulin:
When glycemic control is not achieved with the maximum tolerable dose of a single 
oral agent or combination of oral drugs, combination of oral drugs and insulin can help 
to achieve good control of diabetes. Oral drugs may be continued in optimal doses, 
while intermediate acting/long acting/short acting insulin is added either at bedtime or 
in the morning depending on the blood glucose profile of the patient. When premixed 
or multiple dose insulin is given, consideration may be given to reducing the dose of 
secretagogues or stopping them altogether.
7.1.11 Use of Indigenous Drugs:
Many people with diabetes in our country use indigenous drugs from other 
systems of medicine like Ayurveda, Homeopathy, Unani etc. Several herbal products 
have been advocated for the treatment of diabetes such as Pterocarpus marsupium, 
Gymnema sylvestre, Mormordica chirantica, Eugenia jambolana etc. These drugs by 
themselves or in combination, do have blood glucose lowering effects. Their exact 
mechanism of action is still not clear. There is a common belief that all herbal drugs 
are safe and non-toxic which is not necessarily true.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201839
In view of the widespread use of these indigenous medicines, physicians should 
be aware of the herb-drug interactions. There is ample scope for research and careful 
evaluation of these agents needs to be done in the management of diabetes.
7.2 Insulin  therapy
Insulin is the mainstay of therapy in type 1 diabetes. However, many patients with 
type 2 diabetes will also require insulin injections to help them achieve their glycemic 
targets.
7.2.1 Indications for the use of insulin in type 2 diabetes mellitus at the time of 
diagnosis: 
 zPerson with diabetes with significant, symptomatic hyperglycaemia, loss of 
weight and polyuria, polydipsia, polyphagia
 zFasting plasma glucose > 270 mg/dl or HbA1c >9%
 zSevere infections 
 zPresence of ketosis
7.2.2 Other situations where insulin is indicated:
 zPatients not responding to optimal doses of oral anti-hyperglycaemic agents 
alone or in combination
 zAcute hyperglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis / hyperglycemic-hyperosmolar  
state / lactic acidosis
 zStressful situations such as acute myocardial infarction, stroke, acute 
infections, tuberculosis*,trauma and other conditions requiring hospitalisation 
 zPregnancy and lactation
 zPeri-operative state
 zIntolerant / contraindications to OHA
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201840
 zHepatic and renal failure
 zRenal transplantation - Oral agents can be used
 zPerson with diabetes on steroids
* Decision left to discretion of treating physician
7.2.3 Types of insulin preparations:
Different types of insulin are available. They have different pharmacokinetic 
properties. Insulin type, injection technique, insulin antibodies, site of injection and 
individual patient response differences can affect the onset, degree and duration of 
insulin activity.
Human insulin manufactured by rDNA technology and insulin analogues are the 
only insulins available at present. Animal insulin is no longer available.
(i) Human insulin:
 zShort acting – human soluble insulin (regular)
 zIntermediate acting – neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH)
 zPremixed- mixtures of regular and NPH insulin in 25/75, 30/70, 50/50 proportion
(ii) Insulin Analogues: 
 zRapid acting  (e.g. Lispro, Aspart, Glulisine)
 zLong acting (Glargine, Degludec, Detemir)
 zPremixed Insulin analogue (Lispro/ lispro protamine, aspart/ aspart protamine)    
 z  Co-formulations (Degludec + Aspart insulin) 
Insulin degludec/i nsulin aspart (IDegAsp) is a soluble formulation of the novel 
basal analogue insulin degludec(70%) and insulin aspart (IAsp: 30%)
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201841
7.2.4 Insulin action profiles (Figure 7.4) :
Figure 7.4: Insulin Profiles After Subcutaneous Injections
7.2.5 Storage of insulin: 
 zInsulin not in use should be refrigerated in the lower compartment of the door 
of the refrigerator. It should not be kept in the freezer compartment. Ideal 
storage temperature is 2-8° C
 zInsulin should not be exposed to direct sunlight / heat
 zExcess agitation should be avoided to prevent loss of potency, clumping, 
frosting or precipitation
 zIf refrigeration is not available, insulin should be stored in a cool place – e.g., 
in an earthenware pot of water (inside a plastic bag)
 zIf regular insulin shows haziness, it should not be used. If cloudy insulin cannot 
be re-suspended, it should not be used
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201842
7.2.6 Mixing of insulin :
 zAdministration of mixtures of short and intermediate insulin will produce better 
glycemic control than use of single insulin in some patients
 zRegular and NPH insulin can be mixed but must be injected immediately after 
mixing
Sequence of mixing insulin  is shown in  Figure 7.5
Figure 7.5: Procedure for mixing insulin
 zBefore each injection, the hands and the injection site should be cleaned
 zThe top of the insulin vial should be wiped with spirit
 zFor cloudy insulin preparations (NPH and human and analogue premixes), 
the vial should be gently rolled in the palms of the hands (not shaken) to 
re-suspend the insulin
 zAn amount of air equal to the dose of insulin required should first be drawn 
up and injected into the vial to avoid creating a vacuum
 z For a mixed dose, putting sufficient air into both bottles before drawing up 
the dose is important
 zIn case, insulin has to be mixed in the same syringe (the mixing of rapid or 
short acting insulin with NPH), the clear rapid or short acting insulin should 
be drawn into the syringe first
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201843
7.2.7 Use of syringes:
 zConventional insulin administration involves subcutaneous injection with 
syringes marked in insulin units
 zThere may be differences in the way units are indicated (U-40, U-100) and in 
India, both are available in 1 ml syringe. Fixed needle (single unit) syringes 
are desirable
 zIt is important to make sure that there is no syringe-vial mismatch as far as 
insulin concentration is concerned e.g. U-40 syringe must be used only for 
U-40 insulin
 zSyringes and needles must never be shared with another person
 zIf reuse is planned, the needle must be carefully recapped after each use. The 
needle should not be wiped or washed
 zChange needles after 3-4 uses, otherwise there is a risk of needle getting 
infected
7.2.8 Insulin administration:
(i) Insulin pens: 
 zSeveral pen-like devices and insulin containing cartridges are available that 
deliver insulin subcutaneously through a needle
 zThey are easy to use
(ii) Insulin pumps:
 zInsulin pump for continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion is available in India 
with integrated algorithm, which can automatically stop release of insulin thirty 
minutes before onset of hypoglycemia. It is indicated for those with brittle 
diabetes, multiple dose injections and recurrent episodes of hypoglycaemia
 zIts use may be restricted to diabetes specialists with relevant experience
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201844
The main problems associated with insulin use are hypoglycaemia and weight gain. 
Weight gain can be significant and is generally well correlated with the total daily dose 
of insulin. Used needles must be disposed off in a bio-safe manner. For initiating insulin, 
it is not necessary to hospitalize the patient. It can be done on outpatient basis.
Insulin colour coding:
Grey - Intermediate
Yellow - regular insulin
Green - NPH
Brown - Premix insulin
(iii)  Injection procedure (Figure 7.6):
 zInjections are given into the subcutaneous tissue
 zInject insulin by lifting up a fold of skin and inject at a 90°° angle
 zThin individuals or children may need to pinch the skin and inject at a 45° 
angle to avoid intramuscular injection, especially in the thigh area
Figure 7.6 Procedure for injecting insulin

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201845
(iv) Injection site:
 zInsulin may be injected into the subcutaneous tissue of the upper arm, the 
anterior and lateral aspects of the thigh, the buttocks and the abdomen. For 
self injection, abdomen and thigh are the convenient sites
 zRotation of the injection site is important to prevent lipohypertrophy or 
lipoatrophy. Rotating within one area is recommended (e.g. rotating injections 
systematically within the abdomen) rather than rotating to a different area with 
each injection. This practice may decrease variability in absorption from day 
to day
 zSite selection should take into consideration the variable absorption between 
sites. The abdomen has the fastest rate of absorption followed by the arms, 
thighs and buttocks
 zExercise increases the rate of absorption from the injection sites
 zThe most commonly recommended interval between injection of short acting 
(regular) / premixed insulin and a meal is 30 min. However, insulin analogues 
can be given along with or even after a meal
Figure 7.7  Recommended sites for insulin injection

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201846
(v)  Adverse effects associated with insulin use:
 zThe main problems associated with insulin use are hypoglycaemia and weight 
gain
 zWeight gain can be significant and is generally well correlated with the total 
daily dose of insulin
(vi) Disposal of needles:
 z Used needles must be disposed of in a bio-safe manner. Used sharps should 
be collected in a strong cardboard/ glass container, sealed and labelled and 
handed over to the nearest healthcare facility
(vii) Initiation of insulin:
 zFor initiating insulin, it is not necessary to hospitalize the patient. It can be 
done on outpatient basis
 zThe dose has to be individualized depending upon the blood glucose profile 
and clinical setting
 zIt is better to start with small doses and modify as needed every three days
 zGenerally, the starting dose of insulin should be 0.2 units/kg/day
(viii) Adding insulin to oral antihyperglycaemic agents: 
When combinations of oral antihyperglycaemic agents no longer maintain the level 
of control desired, insulin is needed ( see Section 7.1 )
(ix) Multiple insulin injections: 
 zWhen a single insulin injection plus one or more oral agents no longer maintains 
good glucose control, two or more injections are needed
 zA regimen containing mixtures of NPH and regular insulin mixed in different 
ratios (e.g. 25:75,  30:70, 50:50) either mixed by the individual or premixed, 
taken before breakfast and dinner is a reasonable way to start multiple 
injections
 zOlder persons need careful monitoring to avoid hypoglycaemia
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201847
7.3 Non-insulin injectable therapy (GLP-1 receptor agonists)
The incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose dependent 
insulinotropic peptide  (GIP) are secreted from the gut in response to a meal and bring 
about glucose-dependent insulin secretion from the beta cells of the pancreas and 
suppression of glucagon release from the alpha cells. The GLP-1 receptor analogues 
currently available are resistant to degradation by the DPP-4 enzyme and hence have 
longer half-lives than native GLP-1. The main advantages of these agents are that 
they reduce hyperglycaemia with minimal risk of hypoglycaemia and also promote 
weight loss. The main side effects are nausea and vomiting; a few cases of acute 
pancreatitis have also been reported. They can be combined with all other classes 
of anti-hyperglycaemic agents except the DPP-4 inhibitors. There is some evidence 
that these agents improve cardiovascular outcomes over and beyond their effects 
on blood glucose. Exenatide, liraglutide, lixisenatide and dulaglutide are the GLP-1 
receptor agonists available in India at present (Table 7.2). They can be taken at any 
time of day, but preferably at the same time every day.

SECTION 8 COMPLICATIONS OF DIABETES
Most of the morbidity and mortality due to diabetes arises on account of its 
complications. Diabetes complications can be broadly divided into acute and chronic 
complications. Acute complications include hypo- and hyperglycaemic emergencies 
whereas chronic complications include microvascular disease (retinopathy, 
nephropathy and neuropathy), macrovascular disease (coronary artery disease, 
cerebrovascular disease and peripheral vascular disease) and diabetic foot.
8.1 Acute Complications
8.1.1 Hypoglycaemia:
It is a common side effect due to drug therapy of diabetes especially sulphonylureas 
and insulin. The patient may have classical symptoms like hunger, sweating, tremors, 
palpitation with or without loss of consciousness.
Steps to be taken:
 zIf glucose monitor is available, random plasma glucose should be estimated
 zIf glucose monitor is not available and patient is conscious, he should be 
treated with oral glucose/ sweets/sugar
 zIf patient is brought in unconscious state, give 25-50 ml of 25% dextrose IV
 zIf there is inadequate response, maintain a 5% dextrose drip and refer to 
hospital immediately
 zIf recurrent hypoglycaemia persists, check for renal function and hypothyroidism
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201849
8.1.2  Hyperglycaemic emergencies (Diabetic Ketoacidosis- DKA or 
Hyperosmolar Hyperglycaemic State- HHS): 
Usually such emergencies occur in situations like infections or other stressful 
conditions. There is usual history of missed dose of insulin or poor control of diabetes. 
DKA is characterized by abdominal pain and is manifested with breathlessness, 
vomiting, altered sensorium and dehydration. The symptoms of HHS are predominantly 
neurological; dehydration is usually more profound but abdominal pain is uncommon.
Steps to be taken:
 zMonitor glucose levels
 zCheck for urine ketones
 zIntravenous saline infusion at 1 litre in half hour should be started immediately 
and refer to hospital
8.2 Chronic Complications 
Diabetes mellitus is a systemic disorder, which potentially can cause serious organ 
damage involving eyes, heart, kidney, nerves and limbs, which ultimately can lead to 
blindness, heart attack, kidney failure and limb amputation respectively. If diagnosed 
early and treated in time appropriately, the damage to some of these organs can be 
largely prevented or reversed. Another important issue is that most complications 
cause clinical symptoms only at a very late stage and thus for their early diagnosis, 
these complications have to be specifically looked for even at the time of prediabetes. 
Considering this, the following approach is advisable for management of people with 
type 2 diabetes.
On the first clinic visit detailed history and a thorough examination with preliminary 
tests are essential. Additional investigations may be necessary if there are high 
risk factors in the patient and/or there is any abnormality in history, examination 
and preliminary investigations. At that stage, these patients need to be referred to 
specialists for further management.

8.3 Coronary Artery Disease
 zWhen patient is asymptomatic with abnormal E.C.G, refer to specialist / 
physician / cardiologist
 zIf the symptoms suggest suspicion of unstable angina / acute myocardial 
infarction (MI) , give aspirin (300 mg to be chewed) and statin (e.g. Atorvastatin 
80 mg) and refer to nearest hospital urgently
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201852
8.4 Diabetic Nephropathy 
8.4.1 Investigations:
 zUrine microscopy (Casts and pus cells, RBC)
 zBlood Urea, Serum creatinine
 zCalculate eGFR
 zMicroalbuminuria
 zUSG abdomen (if feasible)
 zSerum sodium and potassium
8.4.2 Management of albuminuria /proteinuria: 
The algorithm given in the next page outlines the steps in investigation of 
albuminuria / proteinuria in a person with diabetes.
8.4.3 Treatment of hypertension in nephropathy:

blockers (ARB) are the drugs of choice (never combine both)
 zOthers, if ACEIs or ARBs are not tolerated
 zCalcium channel blockers 
 zDiuretics
 zSelective beta blockers (should be given in case of known previous acute 
coronary syndrome)
8.4.4  Refer the patient to nephrologist if:

with diabetes. This will help differentiate proteinuria of diabetic and non-diabetic 
etiology.

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201854
8.5 Diabetic Retinopathy
Ninety percent of blindness from diabetic retinopathy (DR) is preventable by early 
diagnosis and treatment. All physicians dealing with diabetic retinopathy patients in 
large numbers must make an effort at recording visual acuity as an integral part of 
their work up and must strive to develop the skill of direct ophthalmoscopy. If visual 
acuity recording and retinal examination is not possible, all physicians must spend 
time educating their diabetic patients on the strong potential for diabetes to cause 
blindness, about how this can be prevented by regular visit to a retina specialist 
and about the need for an immediate baseline eye examination and blood glucose 
control. Recording of visual acuity and examination of the retina by ophthalmoscopy 
is mandatory in all diabetic patients. Whenever possible retinal photography must be 
obtained. If the services of a retina specialist are available, his / her opinion should 
be sought about the stage of retinopathy, any need for immediate / early treatment 
and about the next follow up visit. If services of a retina specialist are not available, 
then it is advised to compare retinal examination findings and/or findings on retinal 
photography with representative diabetic retinopathy images and corresponding 
management/ follow up guidelines or refer to the grades of diabetic retinopathy chart 
and advise patients accordingly. 
 zThose patients who have a long history of diabetes, poor glycemic control, 
concurrent hypertension and nephropathy are more likely to have diabetic 
retinopathy
 zPregnant women with diabetes also need frequent retinal examination as 
pregnancy may accelerate the development and progression of retinopathy
 zVisual acuity may be normal despite having diabetic retinopathy
 zHowever, when the visual acuity is found to be decreased in any patient 
with diabetes mellitus, it must be considered to be due to vision threatening 
diabetic retinopathy and the patient must be referred immediately to a retina 
specialist 
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201855
8.5.1 Risk factors:
 zLong duration of diabetes
 zPoor glycemic control
 zUncontrolled hypertension
 zPresence of diabetic nephropathy
8.5.2 General considerations:
 zInform all patients that sight threatening eye disease is a common complication 
of diabetes
 zSevere diabetic retinopathy can be present even with good vision
 zGlasses testing/refraction should not be mistaken for retinal examination
 zPhysicians should impress that it is mandatory to undergo a dilated retinal 
examination preferably by a trained retina specialist
 zVision testing and (if possible) intraocular pressure testing should be done 
before retinal examination in all patients
 zPerson with impaired vision (< 6/60) should undergo low vision evaluation and 
rehabilitation
 zPerson with diabetes should be screened for other causes of visual loss like 
cataract, glaucoma and macular degeneration
8.5.3 Screening recommendation for retinal examination *: 
Patient Group When to screen first Routine follow-up
Type 1 diabetes Within 5 years of diagnosis Annually thereafter
Type 2 diabetes At time of diagnosis    Annually thereafter
Pregnancy in pre-existing diabetes, retinal examination prior to conception and 
during pregnancy, refer to the ophthalmologist / retina specialist  early in the first 
trimester
* Based on the findings during the fundus examination, subsequent follow up advice is provided.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201856
8.6 Diabetic Neuropathy
8.6.1 Diagnosis & clinical recognition:
 zSensory neuropathy is evidenced by symptoms of paresthesiae (such as 
tingling, numbness and pain) or loss of sensation of touch, pain, temperature 
and vibration
 zNeuropathy can lead to foot deformities and dryness of plantar skin leading 
to neuropathic foot ulcers. These ulcers are susceptible for infection, cellulitis 
and osteomyelitis often requiring partial foot amputation
 zMotor weakness of small muscles of foot is evidenced by inability to grip 
footwear and alteration of arch of foot, bringing pressure on the head of first 
metatarsal and heel
 zQuadriceps wasting and absent knee jerk and bilateral hip muscle weakness 
suggest diabetic amyotrophy
 zCranial motor neuropathy involving 3rd, 6th and rarely 7th nerve must be 
considered in relevant cases 
 zRadiculopathy and cranial neuropathies are reversible while sensorimotor 
symmetrical polyneuropathy is progressive and irreversible
 zAssess for autonomic neuropathy with symptoms such as orthostatic 
hypotension, gastroparesis, diarrhoea /constipation, impotence, cystopathy 
and gustatory sweating
 zAlways exclude other causes of neuropathy for example nutritional deficiency, 
hypothyroidism, spinal disorders, paraneoplastic syndrome, drug induced, 
alcohol abuse, uremic neuropathies, etc.
8.6.2 Clinical examination:
 zFor sensation as described under foot examination
 zMotor power assessment and tendon jerks
 zExamination of BP in sitting and standing positions and ECG for heart rate 
variability may be useful in diagnosing autonomic neuropathy
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201857
8.6.3 Investigations:
 zTSH
 zVitamin B12 assay (if possible)
 zParaproteinemias (if possible )
Refer atypical cases to a neurologist for further investigations like nerve conduction 
studies etc.
8.6.4 Treatment:
 zTight glycemic control is essential. If there is painful peripheral neuropathy, 
drugs such as antiepileptics (gabapentin, pregabalin), tricyclic antidepressants 
(TCAs) (amitryptiline, imipramine), and serotonin and noradrenaline reuptake 
inhibitors (SNRIs), (venlafaxine, duloxetine) are the first line medications. 
Either the maximum dose of each drug or a combination of two drugs must be 
tried to give relief. In resistant painful neuropathies use of second line drugs 
like opioids (tramadol) is also advised
 zIf patient has symptoms and signs of numbness and loss of sensation, follow 
the guideline given under foot care to protect the foot from ulceration
 zSexual dysfunction in males should be referred to specialists for appropriate 
therapy
8.7 Diabetic Foot
8.7.1 Diabetic foot screening:
This aims at categorizing feet into Low risk, At Risk or Active Foot Disease.  
Examination of a patient should include:
8.7.1.1. Foot inspection:
 zInspection of skin, nails and for structural foot deformity
 zExamination of footwear
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201858
 zRecord presence of:
• toe deformities like claw toes, hammer toe  
• bunion
• high arch foot (pes cavus)  
• Charcot foot 
8.7.1.2. 10g monofilament sensation: 
It delivers a 10 gram force when applied so as to make it buckle.
 zApply the monofilament perpendicular to the skin’s surface (see Figure 8.2.A  
below)
 zApply sufficient force to cause the filament to bend or buckle (see Figure 
8.2.B  below)
 zThe total duration of the approach, skin contact, and departure of the filament 
should be approximately 1- 2 seconds
 zApply the filament along the perimeter and NOT ON an ulcer site, callus, scar 
or necrotic tissue. Do not allow the filament to slide across the skin or make 
repetitive contact at the test site
 zA person who cannot feel the 10 gram filament at the selected sites 
(Figure 8.2.C ) is at increased risk for developing ulcers
Figure 8.2. The monofilament test
Figure 8.2.A Figure 8.2.B Figure 8.2.C
 

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201859
8.7.1.3. Vibration perception (128 Hz tuning fork): 
Place the stem of the fork over the bony prominences of the foot (big toe and 
medial malleolus) and ask the patient if he feels the vibration. Record the result as 
absent, reduced or present depending on the patient’s response. If absent, check at 
more proximal sites such as tibial tuberosity and anterior superior iliac spine.
8.7.1.4. Biothesiometer test:
The vibration perception threshold (VPT) is examined using a biothesiometer with 
the patient in the supine position with or without eyes closed. 
8.7.1.5. Vascular assessment:
This involves the manual palpation of the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial pulses 
in both feet. Ankle brachial pressure index (ABI) using hand held Doppler should 
be assessed if peripheral pulsations are absent or clinical suspicion of peripheral 
ischaemia (Normal ABI is between 0.9 to 1.3).
8.7.2. Risk categorization: 
Risk categorization method for basic foot screening involves history of diabetes-
related foot complications, medical history, and assessment of peripheral sensation, 
arterial supply and presence of foot deformity ( Table 8.1 )

ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201861
8.7.3. General Principles of Management :
 zThere is no need for a patient with low risk of diabetic foot disease to routinely 
see a podiatrist / physiotherapist for diabetes related purposes
 zAll patients with diabetes should receive foot care education (See Do’s and 
Don’ts - Table 8.2 )
 zRisk factors like tobacco use should be controlled in every case
 zPatients with foot deformity that interferes with the function of the foot or 
the ability to obtain appropriate footwear should be referred for specialist 
assessment
 zSimilarly, patients with absent pedal pulses should be referred for vascular 
assessment
 zIf ulceration is present then refer within 24 hours to multidisciplinary foot care 
service
 zIf there are clinical signs of infection, antibiotics should be commenced 
immediately.  If there are clinical signs of severe/limb threatening infection, 
the patient should be admitted urgently for intravenous antibiotic therapy and 
surgical debridement or referred to appropriate higher centres
8.7.4. Foot care education:
All patients with diabetes should be educated on the do’s and don’ts of foot care 
as listed in the Table 8.2 .
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201862
   Table 8.2: Foot care — Do’s and Don’ts for patients
Do Do not
Inspect feet daily using mirror  Walk barefoot
Wash feet daily in lukewarm water, also 
in between toes   Smoke/Consume excess alcohol
Apply moisturizing lotion to feet after 
drying    Expose to extreme temperature
Have your feet checked at each clinic 
visitUse hot fomentation
Inspect footwear daily for defects/ 
foreign bodiesUse chemicals agents (e.g. corn 
plaster), corn caps or blades to treat 
corns or calluses 
Change footwear regularly   Wear new footwear for more than 
few hours everyday
Buy footwear preferably in the evening  Neglect any minor foot lesions

SECTION 9    DIABETES AND PREGNANCY   
9.1. Pre-gestational diabetes
Women with pre-existing diabetes, (e.g. type 2 or type 1 diabetes) who become 
pregnant are said to have pre-gestational diabetes. Maternal and fetal outcomes are 
good if the pregnancy is planned, preconception checkup done and tight glycemic 
control is achieved. The steps to achieve these are:
 zTight glycemic control (preferably HbA1C (< 6.5%) is ideal before a planned 
pregnancy
 zFolic acid supplementation should be given
 zAntihypertensive agents should be changed to calcium channel blockers or 
alpha methyldopa
 zACEIs, ARBs, Diuretics and Statins should be discontinued
 zPre-pregnancy baseline evaluation of eyes and kidney function must be done
 zOptimisation of nutritional status, anaemia and pre-pregnancy weight should 
be done
 zMaternal and fetal surveillance during pregnancy should ideally be done by an 
obstetrician and physician
9.2 Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM)
Glucose intolerance of any severity detected for the first time during pregnancy is 
termed as gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM).
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201864
9.2.1 Screening for gestational diabetes: 
9.2.1a Indications:
   Ideally all pregnant women in India should be screened for GDM i.e. universal 
screening.  In case this is not possible, and only selective screening is done,  at least 
the following women should be screened:
 zHistory of GDM
 zFirst degree relative with diabetes
 zPre-pregnancy obesity (BMI > 25 kg/m2)
 zHistory of large weight babies (>3.5kgs)
 zBad obstetric history;  - stillbirth, congenital anomalies, recurrent pregnancy 
loss, eclampsia, hydramnios
 zRepeated or persistent urinary tract infection
 zGlycosuria during pregnancy
 zAge above 25 years
However, if all these criteria are employed there will be very few women who are 
at low risk and do not need screening for GDM.  Hence, it is better to try to screen all 
pregnant women for GDM.
9.2.1b Screening methods for GDM:
Screening for diabetes is ideally done at the first antenatal visit.  Screening at 
the first trimester is mainly to rule out pre-existing diabetes. For this, fasting blood 
glucose or random blood glucose or HbA1C should be done.  If the fasting glucose 
is ≥ 126 mg/dl or the random glucose is ≥200 mg/dl or HbA1C is ≥6.5%, it indicates 
pre-existing diabetes. A fasting plasma glucose between 92-125 mgs/dl at the first 
trimester screening is considered as GDM according to International Association of 
Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups (IADPSG) criteria. At the second trimester, 
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201865
screening for GDM is done usually between 24 and 28 weeks of gestation. An Oral 
Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT) should be done using 75 gm glucose load using 
the IADPSG criteria (endorsed by WHO 2013 & FIGO 2016).  The following are the 
IADPSG glucose cut-offs for GDM:    
Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dl) ≥ 92
1 hour (mg/dl) ≥ 180
2 hour (mg/dl) ≥ 153
If any one of the values is above these cut-offs, the woman is diagnosed to have 
GDM.
In situations where pregnant women cannot come in a fasting state and in resource 
limited settings, the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Groups of India (DIPSI) guidelines 
of non-fasting 75 gms single 2 Hr post glucose value ≥ 140 mg/dl can be used.
9.3. Management of hyperglycaemia in pregnancy
Exercise and medical nutritional therapy is the first step and initiated in all women 
with GDM. When this fails to achieve the target, medical management is initiated.
Insulin is the preferred drug of choice in diabetes and pregnancy. Currently most 
types of insulin are approved for use in pregnancy except Glargine, Glulisine and 
Degludec.
After the Metformin in GDM (MIG) study, many centres have started using metformin 
as first line in GDM. However more data are needed in Indians.
Besides glycemic control, fetal growth and maternal blood pressure need to be 
monitored.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201866
9.3.1 Goals for therapy:
Fasting Plasma Glucose (mg/dl) <90
1 hour Postprandial Glucose (mg/dl) <140
2 hour Postprandial Glucose (mg/dl) <120
9.4 Post-partum follow up
As 50-70% of women with GDM go on to develop diabetes within 5-10 years after 
delivery, post partum screening for diabetes is necessary.  A 2 hr OGTT using 75g 
glucose should be done 6-8 weeks after delivery for reclassification of diabetes as 
normal, pre-diabetes or diabetes. If normal, the testing should be repeated annually .
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201867
SECTION 10   COMORBID CONDITIONS 
10.1 Hypertension
Hypertension in patient with diabetes more than doubles the risk of morbidity and 
mortality from strokes and heart attacks. It is also one of the important correctable 
factors for reducing the risk of diabetic nephropathy. Hence it is essential that blood 
pressure should be checked on every visit and kept under control. A blood pressure 
(BP) more than 140/90 mm is the trigger to initiate treatment. Initial attempt should 
be made to control the BP by non-pharmacological measures. These include weight 
reduction, dietary modification by reducing salt intake and stress management (if 
possible).
A person with diabetes as well as with hypertension should be treated more 
aggressively than an individual with hypertension but without diabetes.
10.1.1 Blood pressure management and targets:
If blood pressure is >140/90mm Hg
Recheck after 1 week
If still high, drug therapy needs to be initiated with a single drug
1. ACE inhibitors /ARB (do not combine both) (or)
2. Calcium channel blockers
3. Selective beta blockers or diuretics (as a third line option if 
indicated)
If the blood pressure remains >140/90 mm Hg after 1 month of monotherapy, add 
a second drug from a different class (do not combine ACEI and ARB). If BP is not 
controlled even with optimal doses of two agents, referral to a specialist is indicated. 
In patients with diabetic renal disease, even lower BP targets are recommended.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201868
10.1.2 Severe hypertension:
 If at initial visit, blood pressure is > 180/110 mm Hg, or the patient has evidence 
of end organ damage, treatment should be initiated with two drugs initially and patient 
should be referred to a specialist as early as possible.
10.2. Dyslipidaemia
 All patients with diabetes should be screened for dyslipidaemia and if present 
should be treated aggressively
10.3. Obesity 
Weight reduction should be attempted in obese individuals with obesity. Lifestyle 
modification is the main stay of treatment and judiciously drugs may be used as an 
adjuvant. In morbid obesity, bariatric surgery may be an option.  
10.4 Tuberculosis
Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the major public health problems in India. The 
prevalence of diabetes is high among people with TB in India and about 25% of TB 
patients were found to have diabetes and 24%, pre-diabetes. Diabetes is believed 
to elevate the risk of contracting TB by 2.5 to 3-fold. There should be a high index 
of suspicion for TB in all patients with diabetes. Wherever clinically indicated, initial 
evaluation of a patient with diabetes should include a chest X-ray .
Reducing morbidity and mortality due to TB and DM can be achieved through 
integrated approach of prevention, bidirectional screening for early detection in routine 
health care setting and management strategies through integration of services for TB 
and diabetes. Insulin is preferred if diabetes is uncontrolled or the TB is extensive.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201869
SUMMARY OF GUIDELINES
1.  Screening and Diagnosis
1.1   All individuals aged 30 years and above should be screened for diabetes.
Screening should be carried out at an earlier age in those with additional risk    
factors.
1.2   The oral glucose tolerance test is the diagnostic test of choice. Other options   
include fasting plasma glucose, random plasma glucose (in the presence of 
symptoms) and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c).
1.3    The diagnosis of diabetes should be confirmed by a repeat test on a different 
day (unless there is unequivocal hyperglycemia).
2.  Management of Hyperglycemia
2.1   Education regarding the disease and its management should be provided to all 
patients.
2.2   Lifestyle modification, including information on healthy dietary practices and  
sufficient physical activity, should be the first line of management.
2.3   Metformin is the initial pharamacotherapy of choice for most patients (unless        
specific contraindications or tolerance issues exist, or the patient has 
symptomatic hyperglycemia).
2.4   Sulphonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and sodium glucose 
cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors are the preferred second line oral agents. 
Other alternatives include thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, 
glinides and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists.
2.5   Consider triple oral therapy or initiation of insulin in patients not at target with 
dual therapy.
2.6   Most patients with type 2 diabetes should aim to keep their HbA1c below 7%. 
However, treatment targets need to be individualized.
ICMR Guidelines for Management of Type 2 Diabetes 201870
3.  Management of Complications and Comorbidities
3.1   Comprehensive risk factor control should be attempted, aiming at achieving 
optimal levels of blood pressure and lipids, smoking cessation and weight 
reduction in addition to glycemic control.
3.2   Dilated retinal examination should be performed by a trained ophthalmologist at        
the time of first diagnosis of diabetes and at least annually thereafter .
3.3  Kidney function should be assessed at the time of diagnosis and at least annually 
thereafter by means of urine albumin-creatinine ratio and serum creatinine levels 
with calculation of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).
3.4  A comprehensive foot examination should be carried out at the time of first 
diagnosis and at least annually thereafter, focusing on detection of peripheral 
neuropathy and peripheral arterial disease.
4.  Diabetes in pregnancy
4.1  All pregnant women should be screened for diabetes at the first antenatal visit.
4.2  Screening is ideally performed by means of an OGTT, utilizing thresholds 
suggested by the International Association of Diabetes in Pregnancy Study 
Groups (IADPSG). Alternatively, the Diabetes in Pregnancy Study Group India 
(DIPSI) criteria can be used if the woman is unable to come in the fasting state.
4.3  While lifestyle modification is the initial management option for women with 
gestational diabetes, most patients will need insulin. Oral antihyperglycemic 
agents are best avoided.
4.4  All women with gestational diabetes should undergo an OGTT 6 weeks after 
delivery to reclassify their gl ycemic status
5.  Prevention of Diabetes
5.1  Prevent ion of diabetes can be carried out at primordial, primary, secondary and 
tertiary levels.
5.2  Individuals with pre-diabetes should receive education on intensive lifestyle 
modification so as to delay or prevent their progr ession to diabetes.
